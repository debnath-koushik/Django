## üöÄ Creating a Django Project

To start a new Django project, use the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject project_name
```

This will create a new folder structure for your Django project, including the necessary configuration files.

---

Sure! Here's the updated section with the command to **run the Django development server**, including how to **choose a custom port**, explained in a beginner-friendly way for your `README.md`.

---

## üöÄ Running the Django Development Server

Once you‚Äôve created your Django project and set it up, you can start the development server using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

By default, this runs the server at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

---

### üåê Choosing a Custom Port

If port `8000` is already in use or you prefer to use another port (e.g., `5000`, `8080`, etc.), you can specify it like this:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 5000
```

This will run your server at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

You can even specify a different IP and port (useful for testing on local networks):

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

This makes your server accessible to **other devices on the same network** (e.g., mobile or another PC).

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Command                                   | Description                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `python manage.py runserver`              | Start server on default port `8000`     |
| `python manage.py runserver 5000`         | Start server on custom port `5000`      |
| `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` | Make server accessible on local network |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The development server is only for development and testing. For production, use a proper web server like **Gunicorn** or **Daphne** with **WSGI** or **ASGI**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Django Server Interfaces: WSGI vs ASGI

Django supports two types of server interfaces:

### 1. **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)** ‚Äì Traditional (Synchronous)

* **Default in Django**
* Designed to handle standard **HTTP/HTTPS** requests
* **Stateless protocol**: Each request is independent of the others
* Common use cases:

  * E-commerce websites
  * Blogs
  * News sites
* In your `settings.py`, WSGI is set by default:

  ```python
  WSGI_APPLICATION = 'project_name.wsgi.application'
  ```

---

### 2. **ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)** ‚Äì Real-Time (Asynchronous)

* Designed to handle **real-time communication** and **websockets**
* Supports both **stateful and stateless protocols**
* **Stateful protocol**: Maintains a connection between client and server
* Use cases:

  * Chat applications
  * Video/audio calls
  * Live document editing (e.g., Google Docs)
* To enable ASGI, add the following in your `settings.py`:

  ```python
  ASGI_APPLICATION = 'project_name.asgi.application'
  ```

---

## üìñ Stateless vs Stateful Protocols

| Protocol Type | Description                                                                | Examples                                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stateless** | Each request is independent; the server doesn‚Äôt remember previous requests | HTTP, HTTPS                                              |
| **Stateful**  | Maintains a continuous connection with the client                          | WebSocket, Chat apps, video calls, collaborative editors |

---

## üìù Summary

* **WSGI** is great for traditional web applications (like blogs, stores).
* **ASGI** is needed for real-time features (like chat or notifications).
* Django supports both ‚Äî you choose based on your app‚Äôs needs.

---

## üß© Django Apps

In Django, **apps** are like **independent sub-modules** of your main project.
They help you break your project into smaller, manageable parts ‚Äî each with its own responsibility.

---

### üß† What is a Django App?

* A **Django app** is a Python package that contains a specific functionality or feature of your overall project.
* Each app can have its own:

  * `models.py` ‚Äì for database models
  * `views.py` ‚Äì for handling logic and responses
  * `templates/` ‚Äì for HTML templates
  * `urls.py` ‚Äì for routing (URL handling)

---

### üì¶ Why Use Django Apps?

* To **organize** your project better
* To **reuse** functionality
* To **separate concerns** (each app has its own job)
* To easily plug in **third-party apps** or create your own

---

### üõçÔ∏è Example: E-commerce Project

Imagine you're building an **e-commerce website**. You might break it down into these apps:

| App Name    | Responsibility                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `accounts`  | Handles user registration/login  |
| `products`  | Manages product listings         |
| `orders`    | Handles customer orders          |
| `payments`  | Integrates with payment gateways |
| `logistics` | Manages shipping and tracking    |

Each of these is a **Django app** ‚Äî a self-contained module of your project.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
> Do **not** create an app named `admin` ‚Äî Django already has a built-in `admin` app.
> Creating your own `admin` app **can cause conflicts** and break admin-related functionality.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Create a New App

To create a new Django app, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp app_name
```

> Replace `app_name` with your desired name (e.g., `accounts`, `blog`, etc.)

---

### üîå Add App to Project

Once created, add your app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your `settings.py` file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'app_name',
    ...
]
```

This tells Django to recognize and use the app as part of your project.

---

### üåç Third-Party Django Apps

You can also use ready-made apps developed by others. Just install them with `pip`:

```bash
pip install django-someapp
```

Then add it to `INSTALLED_APPS`, and you're good to go!

---

## üñºÔ∏è Returning HTML Content

You can return HTML directly in `HttpResponse`:

```python
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Welcome to My Django Site</h1><p>This is the home page.</p>")
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This works for small responses, but for larger HTML pages, it‚Äôs better to use **templates**.

---

### üìë Returning HTML Using Templates

Instead of hardcoding HTML in your views, use Django‚Äôs **template system**:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')
```

```html
<!-- templates/home.html -->
<h1>Welcome to My Django Site</h1>
<p>This is the home page.</p>
```

This approach keeps your HTML and Python code separate (cleaner & easier to maintain).

---

### üì¨ Returning JSON Response (for APIs)

If you want to send JSON (often used in APIs or AJAX requests):

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse

def get_data(request):
    data = {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25,
        "city": "New York"
    }
    return JsonResponse(data)
```

Browser output:

```json
{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Response Type      | Function/Method | Example Use Case      |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Plain text / HTML  | `HttpResponse`  | Simple messages/pages |
| HTML from template | `render()`      | Web pages             |
| JSON               | `JsonResponse`  | APIs, AJAX responses  |

---

> üí° **Tip:** Always return an HTTP response object ‚Äî Django won‚Äôt understand plain strings or numbers without wrapping them.

---

## üîó Mapping Views to URLs

For a view to work, it needs to be connected to a **URL pattern**.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping from the Main Project‚Äôs `urls.py`

If you created `hello_world` in your **main project folder** (`views.py` inside the folder with `settings.py`):

```python
# project_name/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views  # Import views from main project

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('hello/', views.hello_world),  # Map URL to view
]
```

Now visiting:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/
```

will show:

```
Hello, World!
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping from an App‚Äôs `urls.py`

If the view is inside an **app** (e.g., `blog/views.py`):

**`blog/views.py`**

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def blog_home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to the Blog!")
```

**`blog/urls.py`** (create this file inside the app if it doesn‚Äôt exist):

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.blog_home, name='blog_home'),  # Empty string = root of blog/
]
```
or,

```python
from django.urls import path
from myproject.views import method1, method2  # add app name in the place of myproject

urlpatterns = [
    path('', method1, name='method1'),  
]
```

**`project_name/urls.py`** (main URL configuration):

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include  # include lets you link to app URLs

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),  # Include blog app's URLs
]
```

Now visiting:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/
```

will show:

```
Welcome to the Blog!
```
